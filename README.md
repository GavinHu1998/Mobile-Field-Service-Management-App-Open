## Project Overview

## ðŸ§© Core Features

### 1. **Authentication & Secure Storage**
- **Login Screen** using `SecureStore` to persist sensitive credentials.
- Token-based authentication handled securely, with error validation.
- Conditional navigation based on token existence.

### 2. **Dashboard with Filtering**
- Fetches jobs dynamically from `https://us-west-1c.zuperpro.com/api/jobs`.
- Supports filtering by creation date (`ASC`, `DESC`, `All`).
- Renders job cards with:
  - Title, creation date, customer name
  - Assigned worker (or shows "Assign to" button if none)
  - Navigation to job details

### 3. **Job Details View**
- Displays full job information including:
  - Category, schedule, customer contact, address
  - Status, creator, invoicing state
- Allows deletion of jobs via confirmation dialog
- Secure API calls using stored token

### 4. **Create Job Entry**
- Form-based interface with:
  - Job title, description, service category (radio options)
  - Customer info and address
  - Date pickers for scheduling
- Token check and validation prior to submission
- Uses `simulate=true` endpoint for test submission

### 5. **User Profile Screen**
- Displays logged-in userâ€™s name, email, role, and avatar
- Offers dynamic login/logout
- Includes external links to companyâ€™s site and subpages

### 6. **Navigation System**
- Bottom tab navigation using `expo-router`
- Tabs: Dashboard, Add Job, Profile
- Hidden tabs: Login (Index), Job Detail
